# FinRoute
FinRoute is a data-driven, gamified simulation platform designed to bridge the financial literacy gap in rural and semi-urban India by transforming complex economic concepts into interactive, behavior-changing experiences.
Built on a foundation of Finite State Machine (FSM)  logic, the system models real-world financial transitions for farmers, women entrepreneurs, students, and young adults, ensuring that every user decision leads to a mathematically consistent outcome. Central to the platform is a proprietary Resilience Score ($R$) algorithm—calculated using variables like seasonal savings, insurance coverage, and debt-to-income ratios—which is visually represented by a dynamic "Health Meter" to provide immediate, intuitive feedback. By integrating vernacular voice narration via the Web Speech API and optimizing for low-bandwidth "shadow zones," FinRoute creates a "human firewall" against 
financial shocks and digital fraud, effectively aligning technical computer science principles with the critical goal of national financial stability.
